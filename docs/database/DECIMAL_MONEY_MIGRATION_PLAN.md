# Decimal Money Migration Plan

> Planning/documentation step only — **Step 3G**. No Prisma schema change, no migration, no API
> code change, no UI code change, no calculation logic change, no Float/Double field converted.
> This document inventories every money-like field in `prisma/schema.prisma` and proposes a safe,
> phased path to `Decimal`, to be implemented in later steps — not here.

## 1. Purpose

**Why money fields should not use Float/Double.** `Float`/`Double` (IEEE 754 binary
floating-point) cannot represent most decimal fractions exactly — `0.1 + 0.2` is `0.30000000000000004`
in JS, and the same binary-rounding behavior exists in MySQL's `DOUBLE` column type that Prisma's
`Float` maps to. For a counter or a percentage this is invisible. For money it is not: every
addition, subtraction, or aggregate (`SUM`) carries a small binary-rounding error that can
accumulate across thousands of rows, post a ledger that doesn't balance to the paisa, or silently
drift a cached balance (`Collection.amountReceivedLakhs`, `EmployeeAdvance.balanceLakhs`,
`FinAccount.currentBalance`) away from the sum of its source rows over time.

This is not theoretical in this codebase. `src/lib/payments.ts`'s `round2()` helper
(`Math.round(n * 100) / 100`) and the `received + 0.001 >= invoice` epsilon-comparison in
`syncCollectionTotals()` exist specifically to paper over float-precision noise on
`Payment.amountLakhs`/`Collection.invoiceValueLakhs` — a real, present symptom of the exact
problem this plan addresses, not a hypothetical one.

**Why Decimal is safer for accounting/finance workflows.** `Decimal` (MySQL's
`DECIMAL(p,s)`, exposed by Prisma as `Decimal` via `@db.Decimal(p,s)`) stores an exact
base-10 fixed-point value — no binary-rounding error, ever. `SUM()` over `DECIMAL` columns is
exact. This is the standard, expected column type for money in every accounting system (Tally,
QuickBooks, SAP, GST e-invoicing) this project will eventually integrate or export to (see
`docs/database/SOFT_DELETE_DECISION_LOG.md` §4's note that money correctness compounds with the
existing soft-delete/audit-log work this project has been doing through Step 3F).

**Why this must be planned before Finance write APIs.** Every Finance write API the project is
about to build (Expense, EmployeeAdvance, TravelClaim, Voucher, Ledger, Payment posting) will
read and write these fields from day one. Converting the column type *after* those APIs exist
means touching every API/UI call site a second time, under live data, instead of building the
APIs against the correct type from the start. Planning now — while only the DB-layer Phase 1
models and soft-delete scaffolding exist (per `docs/database/SOFT_DELETE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
§12's Step 3D/3E/3F progress) — is the cheapest point in the project's history to make this
decision.

**Why this step does not implement schema changes.** Converting a live column's underlying SQL
type (`DOUBLE` → `DECIMAL`) is a data-rewriting operation, not a pure additive
`ADD COLUMN` like the Step 3B soft-delete migration. It must be reviewed, sequenced, and
data-validated deliberately (§7, §8) — not bundled into a documentation step. This document is
the plan; implementation is explicitly deferred to the steps proposed in §9.

## 2. Current Money Field Inventory

Every `Float`/`Float?` field in `prisma/schema.prisma` that represents a monetary amount,
balance, or money-denominated limit/threshold. Model and field names are exact, copied from the
schema.

| Model | Field | Current Type | Usage Area | Recommended Type | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Collection` | `invoiceValueLakhs` | `Float` | Billing/collections — invoice value | `Decimal(18,2)` | **Critical** | Drives `collectionStatus` comparison in `syncCollectionTotals()`; currently needs an epsilon hack (`+0.001`) to compare reliably |
| `Collection` | `amountWithoutGstLakhs` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Billing/collections — pre-GST value | `Decimal(18,2)` | **Critical** | Used in profitability/reporting alongside `invoiceValueLakhs` |
| `Collection` | `amountReceivedLakhs` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Billing/collections — cached received total | `Decimal(18,2)` | **Critical** | CACHED field, re-derived by `syncCollectionTotals()` via `Payment` aggregate — exact `SUM()` matters most here |
| `Payment` | `amountLakhs` | `Float` | Payment ledger — single payment amount | `Decimal(18,2)` | **Critical** | Aggregated (`_sum`) repeatedly in `src/lib/payments.ts`; `round2()` workaround is the concrete symptom this plan fixes |
| `OrderAdvance` | `amountLakhs` | `Float` | Order advance amount | `Decimal(18,2)` | **Critical** | "Order/Invoice totals" per task scope — flows into `Payment.amountLakhs` via `applyAdvance()` |
| `Notification` | `amountLakhs` | `Float?` | Denormalized copy shown in a payment notification | `Decimal(18,2)` | Later | Display-only copy of an already-posted amount; no calculation depends on its precision |
| `FinAccount` | `openingBalance` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Chart of accounts — cash/bank opening balance | `Decimal(18,2)` | **Critical** | Anchors every later balance calculation for the account |
| `FinAccount` | `currentBalance` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Chart of accounts — CACHED running balance | `Decimal(18,2)` | **Critical** | Comment in schema: "written by the cash/bank service only" — a cached running total is exactly where float drift compounds over time |
| `Ledger` | `amountLakhs` | `Float` | General ledger entry amount | `Decimal(18,2)` | **Critical** | Debit/credit posting amount — core accounting record |
| `Expense` | `amountLakhs` | `Float` | Expense register — claimed amount | `Decimal(18,2)` | **Critical** | |
| `Expense` | `gstAmountLakhs` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Expense register — GST amount on the expense | `Decimal(18,2)` | **Critical** | Tax *amount* (currency), not the tax *rate* — see `gstRate` below for the rate field |
| `Voucher` | `amountLakhs` | `Float` | Voucher — posted amount | `Decimal(18,2)` | **Critical** | Voucher is the accounting source-of-truth document; see §10 on sequencing this with Ledger |
| `EmployeeAdvance` | `amountLakhs` | `Float` | Employee advance — requested amount | `Decimal(18,2)` | **Critical** | |
| `EmployeeAdvance` | `disbursedAmountLakhs` | `Float?` | Employee advance — actually disbursed amount | `Decimal(18,2)` | **Critical** | |
| `EmployeeAdvance` | `settledAmountLakhs` | `Float?` | Employee advance — settled amount | `Decimal(18,2)` | **Critical** | |
| `EmployeeAdvance` | `balanceLakhs` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Employee advance — CACHED (disbursed − settled) | `Decimal(18,2)` | **Critical** | Schema comment: "CACHED" — same compounding-drift risk as `FinAccount.currentBalance` |
| `TravelClaim` | `ratePerKm` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Conveyance — ₹ rate per km (HR-policy snapshot) | `Decimal(10,4)` | **Critical** | A money *rate*, not a percentage — multiplies directly into `amountRupees`/`amountLakhs` below; needs more than 2 decimal places of precision since it's a per-unit multiplier |
| `TravelClaim` | `amountRupees` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Conveyance — claim amount in ₹ | `Decimal(18,2)` | **Critical** | |
| `TravelClaim` | `amountLakhs` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Conveyance — claim amount in ₹ Lakhs | `Decimal(18,2)` | **Critical** | Same claim, second denomination — both must convert together or a mismatch is introduced |
| `ApprovalRule` | `autoApproveLimit` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Approval policy — ₹ auto-approve threshold | `Decimal(18,2)` | Important | A money threshold compared against real transaction amounts above; not itself a posted transaction |
| `ApprovalRule` | `level1Limit` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Approval policy — ₹ level-1 threshold | `Decimal(18,2)` | Important | |
| `ApprovalRule` | `level2Limit` | `Float?` | Approval policy — ₹ level-2 threshold | `Decimal(18,2)` | Important | |
| `ApprovalRule` | `level3Limit` | `Float?` | Approval policy — ₹ level-3 threshold | `Decimal(18,2)` | Important | |
| `ExpenseLimitRule` | `dailyLimit` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Expense policy — ₹ daily cap | `Decimal(18,2)` | Important | Configuration/policy limit, not a transaction; lower risk than `Expense.amountLakhs` itself |
| `ExpenseLimitRule` | `monthlyLimit` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Expense policy — ₹ monthly cap | `Decimal(18,2)` | Important | |
| `ExpenseLimitRule` | `yearlyLimit` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Expense policy — ₹ yearly cap | `Decimal(18,2)` | Important | |
| `ConveyancePolicy` | `ratePerKm` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Conveyance policy — configured ₹/km rate | `Decimal(10,4)` | Important | Source of the per-claim `TravelClaim.ratePerKm` snapshot above |
| `ConveyancePolicy` | `monthlyLimitRupees` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Conveyance policy — ₹ monthly cap | `Decimal(18,2)` | Important | |
| `AdvancePolicy` | `maxAdvanceLakhs` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Advance policy — ₹ Lakhs cap | `Decimal(18,2)` | Important | |
| `CustomerCreditPolicy` | `defaultCreditLimitLakhs` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Customer credit policy — ₹ Lakhs default limit | `Decimal(18,2)` | Important | |
| `CustomerCreditPolicy` | `maxCreditLimitLakhs` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Customer credit policy — ₹ Lakhs max limit | `Decimal(18,2)` | Important | |
| `SalesFunnel` | `dealValueLakhs` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Legacy pipeline — deal value estimate | `Decimal(18,2)` | Important | Pipeline/forecast value, not a posted accounting transaction — feeds dashboards/reports, lower correctness stakes than ledger-posted money |
| `SalesFunnel` | `billingValueLakhs` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Legacy pipeline — billing value estimate | `Decimal(18,2)` | Important | |
| `CrmLead` | `expectedValue` | `Float` `@default(0)` | CRM lead — expected deal value | `Decimal(18,2)` | Important | Forecast/estimate, same reasoning as `SalesFunnel` above |
| `CrmOpportunity` | `value` | `Float` `@default(0)` | CRM opportunity — deal value | `Decimal(18,2)` | Important | |
| `CrmOpportunity` | `dealValueExTax` | `Float` `@default(0)` | CRM opportunity — deal value excluding tax (₹L) | `Decimal(18,2)` | Important | Required field when stage → WON; feeds profitability reporting |
| `CrmOpportunity` | `netProfitLakhs` | `Float` `@default(0)` | CRM opportunity — net profit, absolute ₹L (not %) | `Decimal(18,2)` | Important | Schema comment explicitly warns this was renamed from `netMargin` to clarify it's absolute, not a percentage — keep that distinction in mind during conversion |

---

## 3. Non-Money Numeric Fields To Exclude

Fields that are `Float` but are **not** money — included here explicitly so a future
implementation step does not assume "every `Float` is money" and convert them by mistake.

| Model | Field | Current Type | Reason To Keep |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TravelClaim` | `distanceKm` | `Float` `@default(0)` | A physical distance, not a currency amount. Per task guidance, keep `Float` unless the business specifically needs exact-decimal billing on distance itself (it doesn't — `ratePerKm × distanceKm` is computed once into `amountRupees`, which *is* converted above) |
| `TravelClaim` | `fromLat`, `fromLng`, `toLat`, `toLng` | `Float?` | GPS coordinates — geographic precision, unrelated to currency precision |
| `SalesFunnel` | `grossProfitPct` | `Float` `@default(0)` | A percentage (0–100), not a currency amount — see §4 for the separate percentage/rate standard if this is ever revisited |
| `SalesFunnel` | `probabilityPct` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Percentage, not money |
| `CrmOpportunity` | `discountPct` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Percentage (0–100) that *triggers* an approval workflow — not itself a stored money amount |
| `Expense` | `gstRate` | `Float` `@default(0)` | A tax *rate* (e.g. `18` meaning 18%), not a tax amount. Distinct from `Expense.gstAmountLakhs` (the computed currency amount), which **is** in the money table above. If precision ever becomes a concern, this is the candidate for the `Decimal(8,4)` percentage standard in §4 — not the `Decimal(18,2)` money standard |
| `KRATemplateItem` | `weightage` | `Float` `@default(0)` | A weighting percentage for KRA scoring, not money |
| `KRATemplateItem` | `minimumTarget`, `expectedTarget`, `stretchTarget` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Generic KRA target values — `targetType` on the same model can be `"AMOUNT"` or other types, so the *meaning* of this number is metric-dependent, not fixed as money. Do not convert without first auditing which `KRAMetric.metricType` rows actually represent currency |
| `KRAAchievement` | `actualValue` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Same reasoning as above — generic achievement value, metric-dependent meaning |
| `KRAAchievement` | `achievementPct`, `weightedScore` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Percentage/score, not money |
| `PerformanceReview` | `selfRating`, `managerRating`, `finalRating` | `Float` `@default(0)` | Performance ratings (e.g. out of 5), not money |
| `CrmOpportunity` | `probability` | `Int` `@default(50)` | Already an `Int` percentage, not `Float` — not in scope for this Float→Decimal plan at all |

---

## 4. Recommended Decimal Type Standard

| Category | Recommended Type | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| Money amounts (₹, any denomination — Lakhs or Rupees) | `Decimal @db.Decimal(18,2)` | Every "Critical"/"Important"/"Later" row in §2 |
| Money *rates* that multiply into an amount (e.g. ₹/km) | `Decimal @db.Decimal(10,4)` | `TravelClaim.ratePerKm`, `ConveyancePolicy.ratePerKm` — extra precision because these are per-unit multipliers, not final amounts |
| Exchange rates (if ever introduced — none exist in the schema today) | `Decimal @db.Decimal(18,6)` | Not currently applicable; documented for forward compatibility only |
| Tax / percentage / rate fields | `Decimal @db.Decimal(8,4)` **or leave as `Float`/`Int`** | `Expense.gstRate`, `*Pct` fields, `discountPct`, `probability` — decide per-field in the implementation step; none of these are urgent since they are not currency amounts |
| Distance / GPS / non-money numeric | **Unchanged** (`Float`) | `distanceKm`, `fromLat/fromLng/toLat/toLng` — convert only if a future business requirement ties billing precision directly to distance, which it does not today |

`Decimal(18,2)` gives 16 integer digits + 2 decimal places — far beyond any realistic ₹ Lakhs or
₹ Rupees value this system will ever store, with exact paisa-level precision.

---

## 5. API Serialization Impact

Prisma's `Decimal` type (backed by `decimal.js`) is **not** a plain JS `number` — it does not
serialize through `JSON.stringify`/`NextResponse.json()` the way a `Float` does today, and naive
`Number(decimalValue)` conversions silently reintroduce the exact binary-precision loss this
migration exists to eliminate, just one layer higher in the stack.

**Recommendation:**
- Introduce a single, central money-serialization helper (e.g. `src/lib/money.ts`,
  `serializeMoney(decimal): string` / `toMoneyNumber(decimal): number` for display-only contexts)
  **before** any Decimal column conversion happens — not as an afterthought once routes already
  return raw Decimal objects.
- **Do not** scatter ad-hoc `Number(field)` calls across every API route and component — that
  reproduces today's `round2()`-style patchwork (§1) in a new location instead of fixing it.
- For finance-accuracy-sensitive responses (ledger, voucher, payment posting), prefer returning
  money as a **string** (e.g. `"12345.67"`) so the frontend never round-trips through a lossy
  `number` representation. For dashboard/display-only aggregates where exact precision in the
  wire format doesn't matter (a chart, a summary card), a converted `number` via the same central
  helper is acceptable — but it must go through one helper, not be reinvented per-component.
- Existing UI code (e.g. `fmt`/`fmtShort` helpers, independently re-implemented per-page today —
  confirmed via search, no shared formatter currently exists across
  `src/app/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx`, `src/app/finance/bank-book/data.ts`,
  `src/app/finance/FinanceDashboardClient.tsx`, `src/app/masters/customers/data.ts`, etc.)
  currently expects a plain `number`. The serialization helper is what bridges Decimal → the
  `number`/`string` shape each consumer expects, so existing display components are not forced to
  change their input contract on day one of the conversion.

---

## 6. Calculation Rules

To be enforced once Decimal fields exist (not enforced today, since no fields have converted):

- **Never use JS floating-point arithmetic on a persisted accounting total.** `Math.round(n*100)/100`
  (the existing `round2()` pattern in `src/lib/payments.ts`) is the anti-pattern this plan
  retires — once `Payment.amountLakhs`/`Collection.invoiceValueLakhs` are `Decimal`, the rounding
  and the `+0.001` comparison epsilon become unnecessary and should be removed in that
  implementation step.
- **Use Decimal-native operations** (Prisma's `Decimal` arithmetic via `decimal.js`, or
  database-side `SUM()`/`ROUND()` in MySQL) wherever a persisted total is computed — not
  JS-`number` math on values pulled out of Decimal fields.
- **Round only at the final posting/export stage** — e.g. when a Voucher is finalized or an
  amount is exported to an accounting system — not at every intermediate calculation step.
- **Keep GST/tax calculations consistent**: a tax *amount* (`Expense.gstAmountLakhs`) is always
  derived from `amountLakhs × gstRate`, computed once at write time and stored — not
  recalculated ad hoc at read time from a rate that might have since changed.
- **Store final posted amounts explicitly.** Cached/derived fields
  (`Collection.amountReceivedLakhs`, `EmployeeAdvance.balanceLakhs`, `FinAccount.currentBalance`)
  must remain re-derivable from their source ledger (as `syncCollectionTotals()` already does),
  but the stored cache itself is the value APIs read — don't recompute it inline at every read.
- **Avoid recalculating historical posted vouchers after a rate change.** If
  `ConveyancePolicy.ratePerKm` changes, every already-posted `TravelClaim.ratePerKm` (a snapshot,
  per the schema's own comment: "snapshot from HR policy") must remain unchanged — this is
  already the schema's intent today and must be preserved through the Decimal conversion, not
  weakened.

---

## 7. Migration Safety Plan

Defined phases — **none of these are implemented in this step.**

- **Phase A** — Add Decimal migration plan only. *(This document. Complete as of this step.)*
- **Phase B** — Add helper utilities for Decimal serialization/calculation (the `src/lib/money.ts`
  helper from §5), built and unit-checked against mock Decimal values, with **no schema change
  yet** — so the helper exists and is reviewable before any column type changes.
- **Phase C** — Convert low-risk, read-mostly fields first if needed (e.g. policy/limit fields in
  §2's "Important" rows — `ApprovalRule`/`ExpenseLimitRule`/`ConveyancePolicy`/`AdvancePolicy`/
  `CustomerCreditPolicy`) as a lower-stakes dry run of the column-type-change mechanics, before
  touching live transactional ledgers.
  - Convert critical Finance money fields in Prisma schema — `Expense`, `EmployeeAdvance`,
  `TravelClaim`, `Payment`, `Collection` first (per §11), then `Voucher`/`Ledger`/`FinAccount`
  once the accounting-flow review in §10's last bullet is resolved.
- **Phase E** — Update APIs and UI to handle Decimal serialization, using the §5 helper at every
  call site touched by the Phase D schema change — not before, and not by reverting to scattered
  `Number()` conversions.
- **Phase F** — Validate existing data values before and after migration (§8) — row counts, sum
  totals per model, spot-checked individual records.
- **Phase G** — Add regression checks for totals (e.g. a one-off comparison script run before and
  after each Phase D conversion, comparing `SUM()` aggregates and a sample of cached-balance
  fields against their source-ledger recomputation) to catch any silent value drift introduced by
  the `ALTER COLUMN` itself.

---

## 8. Database Migration Risk

- **MySQL `ALTER COLUMN` from `FLOAT`/`DOUBLE` to `DECIMAL` rewrites every row's stored value** —
  this is not a metadata-only change like the additive `ADD COLUMN` work in Step 3B; it can
  change how out-of-range or imprecise existing values are stored, and on a large table it locks/
  rewrites the table during the `ALTER`.
- **Must back up dev and production DB before migration.** No Decimal conversion should run
  against `u686730471_caveodev` (or, far later, production) without a fresh backup immediately
  before the `ALTER TABLE`.
- **Must inspect data ranges** in each column before converting — confirm no existing value
  would silently truncate or round unexpectedly under `DECIMAL(18,2)` (e.g. a stray value with
  more than 2 decimal places of "precision" that was actually float noise, not a real paisa
  value).
- **Must compare before/after totals** — per-model `SUM()` of the converted column, and a sample
  of cached fields (`Collection.amountReceivedLakhs`, `FinAccount.currentBalance`,
  `EmployeeAdvance.balanceLakhs`) recomputed from their source ledgers, both immediately before
  and immediately after each conversion.
- **Must avoid destructive schema drift.** Follow the same discipline as Step 3B's migration
  (`docs/RBAC_MIGRATION_TRACKER.md` §4, Step 3B row): generate the migration SQL, manually review
  every statement, and apply only the intended `ALTER COLUMN` statements — Step 3B's own
  migration diff surfaced unrelated pre-existing schema drift that had to be manually excluded;
  the same discipline applies here.
- **Must use the dev DB first**, exactly as every prior schema-touching step in this project has
  (Step 3B, and the standing CLAUDE.md rule that production changes always require explicit
  confirmation).
- **Must review migration SQL manually** — this project's Hostinger dev DB has no shadow-database
  privilege (`P3014`, documented in `docs/RBAC_MIGRATION_TRACKER.md`'s Step 3B row), so the
  established workaround (`prisma migrate diff --from-config-datasource --to-schema
  prisma/schema.prisma --script`, then a one-off `mariadb`-driver apply script, then `prisma
  migrate resolve --applied`) will apply here too, and that workaround's manual-review step is
  exactly where a Float→Decimal `ALTER COLUMN`'s risk must be caught before it runs.

---

## 9. Suggested Implementation Sequence

Proposed next steps — **not implemented in this step**:

- **Step 3H** — Create Decimal/money utility helpers and serialization standards (the §5
  `src/lib/money.ts` helper), with no schema change yet.
- **Step 3I** — Convert `Expense`/`EmployeeAdvance`/`TravelClaim` money fields to `Decimal` on the
  dev DB only, following the §7/§8 safety plan.
- **Step 3J** — Convert `Payment`/`Collection` money fields to `Decimal` (including the cached
  `Collection.amountReceivedLakhs`), and retire the `round2()`/epsilon-comparison workaround in
  `src/lib/payments.ts` now that the underlying type is exact.
- **Step 3K** — Convert `Voucher`/`Ledger`/`FinAccount` money fields **after** the
  cancellation/reversal accounting-flow design is confirmed (§10's last decision point) — these
  are the most accounting-sensitive models in the schema (per
  `docs/database/SOFT_DELETE_DECISION_LOG.md` §7/§8's existing void/reversal-only decisions for
  Voucher and Ledger) and should not be converted under time pressure alongside the others.
- **Step 3L** — Update dashboard/report calculations (`DashboardClient.tsx`,
  `FinanceDashboardClient.tsx`, profitability views, etc.) to consume the §5 serialization helper
  wherever they read a now-Decimal field.
- **Step 3M** — Run finance data comparison checks (§7 Phase F/G) across all converted models as a
  final regression pass before considering the Decimal migration complete.

---

## 10. Decisions Needed Before Implementation

- Should APIs return Decimal as a **string** (exact, safer) or a **number** (matches today's UI
  expectations, but reintroduces float risk at the serialization boundary)? §5 recommends string
  for posting-sensitive responses, number-via-helper for display-only aggregates — but this needs
  explicit sign-off, not just this document's default.
- Standard precision: confirm **`Decimal(18,2)` for all INR money fields** project-wide (§4), with
  no per-model exceptions, before Step 3H builds the helper around that assumption.
- Should tax rates (`Expense.gstRate` and any future `*Pct`/`discountPct` fields) use
  `Decimal(8,4)`, or is `Float`/`Int` acceptable to leave unchanged since they are not currency
  amounts? §3/§4 lean toward "leave unchanged unless a concrete precision bug is found," but this
  is a decision, not yet a ruling.
- Should distance/conveyance km (`TravelClaim.distanceKm`) remain `Float`? §3 recommends yes —
  needs explicit confirmation that no future billing-by-distance feature will require
  Decimal-level exactness on the distance itself (as opposed to the ₹ amount it produces).
- Should historical Float values be **rounded** during migration (e.g. snap every existing value
  to 2 decimal places as part of the `ALTER COLUMN`), or migrated as-is and only newly-written
  values get the benefit of exact storage going forward? This materially affects whether §8's
  before/after total comparison is expected to match exactly or to show small, explainable
  rounding deltas.
- **Who signs off on before/after totals** for each Phase D conversion (§7)? A named approver (or
  role — e.g. whoever owns Finance Operations sign-off) should be agreed before Step 3I starts,
  not improvised at migration time.
- Should `Voucher`/`Ledger` migration explicitly **wait** until the voucher write/cancellation
  design is finalized, even if that delays Step 3K relative to Step 3I/3J? §9 already sequences
  it last; this decision is whether that's a hard gate or just an ordering preference.

---

## 11. Final Recommendation

- **Do not build Finance write APIs until the critical persisted money fields in §2 have a
  confirmed Decimal migration path** — building new write endpoints against `Float` columns today
  means rebuilding them against `Decimal` columns tomorrow, under live data, instead of once.
- **Start with `Expense`, `EmployeeAdvance`, `TravelClaim`, `Payment`, `Collection`** (§9 Steps
  3I–3J) — these are the models with the most existing application code touching them
  (`src/lib/payments.ts`, the Step 3D/3E/3F soft-delete + audit-log work) and the most immediate
  Finance-write-API exposure.
- **Treat `Voucher`/`Ledger` as accounting-sensitive and migrate only after the
  cancellation/reversal design is confirmed** — consistent with the existing decision in
  `docs/database/SOFT_DELETE_DECISION_LOG.md` §7/§8 that these two models already follow a
  different (void/reversal-only) lifecycle pattern from the rest of Finance.
- **Use a central money serialization/calculation helper** (§5/§9 Step 3H) — built once, reused
  everywhere a Decimal field crosses an API boundary or feeds a calculation, instead of
  reintroducing today's per-component `round2()`/`fmt()` patchwork in a new form.

---

## 12. Document Scope Confirmation

This document is **planning only**. As of this step:
- `prisma/schema.prisma` is unchanged — every field listed in §2 is still `Float`/`Float?` in the
  live schema.
- No migration was generated or applied.
- No API route or UI component was modified.
- No calculation logic (`round2()`, `syncCollectionTotals()`, or any other) was changed.
- `npx prisma validate` passes only because the schema was not touched — this is a no-op
  confirmation, not a meaningful check of anything new (consistent with how
  `docs/database/SOFT_DELETE_DECISION_LOG.md`'s own Step 3B-0 documentation step described its
  identical no-op validation).

> - **Dry-run adoption only — no schema conversion.** `src/lib/money.ts` (Step 3H) was wired into
>   exactly one low-risk, read-only calculation path: the running-balance accumulation loop in
>   `GET /api/finance/bank-book` (`src/app/api/finance/bank-book/route.ts`).

>   `moneyToNumberForDisplay` — matching §6's "round only at the final posting/export/display step"
>   rule instead of rounding at every intermediate step.
> - **No other line in the route changed.** `fmtMoney`/`r2` (the route's existing formatters) are
>   still used everywhere else and still produce the final response strings — the route's JSON
>   shape, field names, and string types are byte-for-byte unchanged.

>   `addMoney`/`subtractMoney` loop. Raw per-step values can differ in the last digit (deferred
>   vs. per-step rounding), but every value is identical once passed through the route's existing
>   `fmtMoney()` boundary call — confirming the API response is unaffected.
> - **Live HTTP verification was not practical this step** (the bank-book route requires an
>   authenticated session against the remote Hostinger dev MySQL database) — static verification
>   (equivalence check above) plus `npx tsc --noEmit` / `npm run build` / `npm run lint` was used

> **Implementation note (Step 3J, 2026-06-22):**
> - **Second dry-run adoption — no schema conversion.** `src/lib/money.ts` adopted in
>   `GET /api/finance/cash-book`'s running-balance accumulation loop
>   (`src/app/api/finance/cash-book/route.ts`), the exact same pattern applied to Bank Book in

> - The loop previously accumulated with `running = r2(running ± entry.amountLakhs)` (Cash In
>   credit → adds, Cash Out debit → subtracts, per the route's existing cash-register
>   convention). It now accumulates with `addMoney`/`subtractMoney` on a `Decimal` seeded via
>   `toMoneyDecimal(periodOpeningBalance)`, converting to a plain `number` only at the loop
>   boundary via `moneyToNumberForDisplay` — rounding deferred to the route's existing final
>   `fmtMoney()` call rather than rounded at every intermediate step.
> - **No other line in the route changed.** All filters (date range, account, employee, type,
>   expense category, status, search), pagination, the `mapTxnType` mapping, and authorization
>   (`canViewFinanceCashBook`) are untouched. Response field names, types, and JSON shape are
>   byte-for-byte unchanged.
> - **Verified equivalent**: a standalone Node check (run via `node -e`, not committed) fed the
>   same opening balance + 6 mixed credit/debit entries (including `0.1 + 0.2`-style float-noise
>   values) through both the old `r2`-per-step loop and the new `addMoney`/`subtractMoney` loop.
>   Raw per-step Decimal values can differ from the old float values in trailing digits (deferred
>   vs. per-step rounding), but every value is identical once passed through the route's existing
>   `fmtMoney()` boundary — confirming the API response is unaffected.
> - **Live HTTP verification was not practical this step** (the cash-book route requires an
>   authenticated session against the remote Hostinger dev MySQL database) — static verification
>   (the equivalence check above) plus `npx tsc --noEmit` / `npm run build` / `npm run lint` was
>   used instead, same limitation as Step 3I.
> - **Validation:** `npx prisma validate` ✅ (no-op, schema untouched), `npx tsc --noEmit` ✅ (no
>   errors), `npm run build` ✅ (all routes including `/finance/cash-book` and `/api/finance/*`
>   compiled), `npm run lint` → 589 problems (414 errors / 175 warnings) — **identical to the
>   Step 3I baseline**, confirming no new lint issues introduced.
> - **No schema/migration/API-contract change.** `prisma/schema.prisma` untouched, no migration
>   generated, no Finance write API created, no response field renamed/retyped, no UI component
>   touched. Bank Book (Step 3I) and Cash Book (this step) are now the only two routes using the
>   Decimal-safe internal running-balance pattern; every other Finance route is unchanged.

> **Implementation note (Step 3K, 2026-06-22):**
> - **Third dry-run adoption — no schema conversion.** `src/lib/money.ts` adopted in the
>   isolated read-only "base + GST = total" addition calculations in `GET /api/finance/expenses`
>   and `GET /api/finance/expenses/[id]` (`src/app/api/finance/expenses/route.ts` and
>   `src/app/api/finance/expenses/[id]/route.ts`).
> - **Expense list route**: the 6 summary aggregates that combine `amountLakhs +
>   gstAmountLakhs` in JS (`totalExpenses`, `todayExpenses`, `pendingApprovalAmount`,
>   `approvedExpenses`, `customerExpenses`, `employeeClaimsPending`) and the per-row
>   `totalAmount` field now use `addMoney(...)` on a `Decimal`, converted back to `number` via
>   `moneyToNumberForDisplay` immediately before the route's existing `fmtMoney()` formatting —
>   the same boundary pattern as Steps 3I/3J. The now-unused local `r2()` helper (its only
>   call sites were these replaced lines) was removed to avoid a dead-code/unused-var lint
>   issue; `fmtMoney()` is untouched and still produces every response string.
> - **Expense detail route**: the single `totalAmount` field (`amountLakhs + gstAmountLakhs`)
>   converted the same way; `r2()` removed there too for the same reason.
> - **`EmployeeAdvance` (`GET /api/finance/advances`) and `TravelClaim`
>   (`GET /api/finance/conveyance`) routes were inspected and left untouched.** Neither contains
>   a JS-level addition/sum combining multiple values — every summary figure in `advances` is a
>   single Prisma `_sum` aggregate formatted directly via `fmt()`, and `conveyance` has no
>   calculation at all (a pure pass-through list). Per this step's own instruction ("if one
>   route has no calculation... leave it untouched and document"), no change was made to either
>   file.
> - **No other line in either changed route was touched.** Authorization
>   (`canViewAllFinanceExpenses`), the `deletedAt: null` filter, date/status/category/vendor/
>   search filters, pagination, and response status codes are all unchanged. Field names, types,
>   and JSON shape are byte-for-byte the same.
> - **Verified equivalent**: a standalone Node check (run via `node -e`, not committed) compared
>   the old `r2(base + gst)` logic against the new `moneyToNumberForDisplay(addMoney(base, gst))`
>   logic across 5 representative sample pairs (including `0.1 + 0.2`, `10.555 + 1.895`, and a
>   3-way `employeeClaimsPending`-style addition) — every value matched once passed through the
>   route's existing `fmtMoney()` boundary.
> - **Live HTTP verification was not practical this step** (both routes require an authenticated
>   session against the remote Hostinger dev MySQL database) — same documented limitation as
>   Steps 3I/3J; the static equivalence check plus the full validation suite was used instead.
> - **Validation:** `npx prisma validate` ✅, `npx tsc --noEmit` ✅ (no errors), `npm run build`
>   ✅ (all routes including `/api/finance/expenses` and `/finance/expenses` compiled),
>   `npm run lint` → 589 problems (414 errors / 175 warnings) — **identical to the Step 3J
>   baseline**, confirming no new lint issues (including no new unused-var warnings from the
>   `r2()` removal).
> - **No schema/migration/API-contract change.** `prisma/schema.prisma` untouched, no migration
>   generated, no Finance write API created, no response field renamed/retyped, no UI component
>   touched, no broad refactor of Advance/Conveyance/other Finance calculations performed.

> **Implementation note (Step 3L, 2026-06-22):**
> - **Fourth dry-run adoption — no schema conversion.** `src/lib/money.ts` adopted in
>   `GET /api/finance/dashboard` (`src/app/api/finance/dashboard/route.ts`) across every
>   JS-level total calculation that combines multiple values — base+GST additions, a running
>   monthly accumulation, and the two net cash/bank-flow subtractions.
> - **Base + GST additions** converted to `moneyToNumberForDisplay(addMoney(base, gst))`:
>   `todayExp`, `monthlyExp`, `customerExp` summary scalars; the per-category `expenseBreakdown`
>   `amount` field; and the per-category `topExpenseCategories` `amt` (feeding both its
>   `amount` and `percentage` fields).
> - **Net flow subtractions** converted to `moneyToNumberForDisplay(subtractMoney(a, b))`:
>   `netCashFlow` (`totalCashIn − totalCashOut`) and `netBankFlow` (`totalCredits − totalDebits`).
> - **Monthly expense trend accumulation** (`monthMap[mo] = r2((monthMap[mo] ?? 0) +
>   e.amountLakhs + e.gstAmountLakhs)`, a 3-way running sum across all trend rows) converted to
>   `monthMap[mo] = moneyToNumberForDisplay(addMoney(monthMap[mo] ?? 0, e.amountLakhs,
>   e.gstAmountLakhs))` — the same "round only at the final boundary" pattern as the Bank
>   Book/Cash Book running-balance loops (Steps 3I/3J), now applied to a per-month bucket instead
>   of a single chronological running total.
> - **Deliberately left unchanged**: `cashBalance`, `bankBalance`, `advOutstanding`,
>   `claimsPending`, `totalCashIn`, `totalCashOut`, `totalCredits`, `totalDebits` — each is a
>   single Prisma `_sum` aggregate with only a `?? 0` fallback, never combined with another value
>   in JS, so there is no addition/subtraction to wire the helper into (per this step's own "if
>   directly returned from a `_sum` and not combined in JS, leave it unchanged" instruction). The
>   `percentage` field's `(amt / totalForPct) * 100` calculation was also left on the existing
>   `r2()` helper — it is a ratio, not a money addition, so it is out of scope for this dry run;
>   `r2()` itself was therefore **not** removed from this file (still has a live call site),
>   unlike the Step 3K `r2()` removal in the Expense routes where every call site was replaced.
> - **No other line in the route changed.** Authorization (`canViewFinanceDashboard`), period
>   resolution (`dateFrom`/`dateTo`/`financialYear`), `branchId`/`accountId` filters, and every
>   `deletedAt: null`-scoped query are untouched — response field names, types, and JSON shape
>   are byte-for-byte the same.
> - **Verified equivalent**: a standalone Node check (run via `node -e`, not committed) compared
>   old-vs-new logic across three calculation shapes used in this route — base+GST addition (4
>   pairs incl. `0.1+0.2`, `10.555+1.895`, and an all-zero/null-coalesced pair), net-flow
>   subtraction (4 pairs incl. `0.3−0.1`), and the 3-way monthly running accumulation (3 chained
>   entries) — every value matched once passed through the route's existing `fmtMoney()`
>   boundary.
> - **Live HTTP verification was not practical this step** (the dashboard route requires an
>   authenticated session against the remote Hostinger dev MySQL database) — same documented
>   limitation as Steps 3I–3K; the static equivalence check plus the full validation suite was
>   used instead.
> - **Validation:** `npx prisma validate` ✅, `npx tsc --noEmit` ✅ (no errors), `npm run build`
>   ✅ (all routes including `/api/finance/dashboard` compiled), `npm run lint` → 589 problems
>   (414 errors / 175 warnings) — **identical to the Step 3K baseline**, confirming no new lint
>   issues.
> - **No schema/migration/API-contract change.** `prisma/schema.prisma` untouched, no migration
>   generated, no Finance write API created, no response field renamed/retyped, no UI component
>   touched. Bank Book, Cash Book, Expense, and Dashboard are now the four routes using
>   Decimal-safe internal arithmetic where a calculation was actually present; Advance and
>   Conveyance remain untouched per Step 3K's findings.

> **Implementation note (Step 3M, 2026-06-22):**
> - **Final dry-run sweep — no code changed, no schema conversion.** Reviewed the remaining six
>   Finance read routes not yet inspected in Steps 3I–3L for any isolated JS-level money
>   calculation suitable for `src/lib/money.ts` adoption. Result: **none qualified** — every
>   route is either a pure pass-through, formats a single direct DB field/`_sum` aggregate with
>   no JS-level addition/subtraction, or performs a non-additive numeric transform that the
>   helper isn't designed for. No file was modified this step.
> - **Classification**:
>   - `GET /api/finance/accounts` — **Pure pass-through.** `openingBalance`/`currentBalance`
>     are formatted directly via the route's existing `fmtMoney()` with no JS-level combination
>     of values. Not a candidate.
>   - `GET /api/finance/vouchers` — **Only direct DB `_sum` value.** `totalVoucherAmount =
>     fmtMoney(r2(totalAmountAgg._sum.amountLakhs ?? 0))` rounds a single aggregate; there is no
>     second value being added or subtracted in JS. Not a candidate — left as-is, consistent with
>     how Step 3L left `cashBalance`/`bankBalance`/`totalCashIn`/etc. untouched for the same
>     reason. (Noted for transparency: Step 3K did convert one single-value case,
>     `gstInputAmount` in the Expense route, to `addMoney(singleValue)` for consistency with its
>     sibling fields in that block — this step takes the more conservative reading for a
>     standalone single-value field with no sibling addition nearby, per this step's own explicit
>     "Only direct DB `_sum` value" classification bucket.)
>   - `GET /api/finance/vouchers/[id]` — **Not suitable for this dry run.** The only money-shaped
>     transform is `amountInWords()` — a unit conversion (₹ Lakhs → ₹ Rupees via `r2(lakhs *
>     100_000)`) followed by whole/paise decomposition for text-to-words formatting
>     (`numberToWords`). This is a display-text generator, not an addition/subtraction of two
>     monetary values, and `src/lib/money.ts` has no decompose-into-words helper — forcing one in
>     would be a new helper, not adoption of an existing one. `amount: fmtMoney(voucher.amountLakhs)`
>     itself is a direct single-field format. Not a candidate.
>   - `GET /api/finance/voucher-sequences` — **Pure pass-through.** No money fields at all —
>     `lastNumber`/`nextNumber` are voucher-numbering counters (integers), not currency. Not a
>     candidate.
>   - `GET /api/finance/advances` — **Only direct DB `_sum` value** (reconfirmed from Step 3K).
>     Every summary figure is a single Prisma `_sum` formatted via `fmt()`; no JS-level addition.
>     Not a candidate.
>   - `GET /api/finance/conveyance` — **Pure pass-through** (reconfirmed from Step 3K). Raw
>     `TravelClaim` field list with zero calculation logic. Not a candidate.
> - **No live verification or equivalence check was needed** — no calculation logic changed, so
>   there is nothing to compare old-vs-new. This was a no-op review by design.
> - **Validation run anyway, per this step's own instruction:** `npx prisma validate` ✅, `npx
>   tsc --noEmit` ✅ (no errors), `npm run build` ✅ (all routes including the 6 reviewed ones
>   compiled, unchanged), `npm run lint` → 589 problems (414 errors / 175 warnings) — **identical
>   to the Step 3L baseline**, as expected with zero file changes.
> - **Dry-run sweep complete.** Across Steps 3I–3M, every Finance read route has now been
>   inspected. Bank Book (3I), Cash Book (3J), Expense list+detail (3K), and Dashboard (3L) had
>   genuine isolated JS-level money calculations and were wired to `src/lib/money.ts`. Accounts,
>   Vouchers, Voucher Detail, Voucher Sequences, Advances, and Conveyance (3M) do not, and remain
>   on their original `fmtMoney()`/`r2()` formatting. **No Prisma schema field was converted, no
>   migration was generated, and no Finance write API was created at any point in this sweep.**

> **Implementation note (Step 3N, 2026-06-22):**
> - Critical Finance Decimal readiness check completed for the 5 critical models named in this
>   step's scope: `Expense`, `EmployeeAdvance`, `TravelClaim`, `Payment`, `Collection`. Full
>   report: `docs/database/DECIMAL_CONVERSION_READINESS_CHECK.md`.
> - Candidate fields (13 money/rate fields across the 5 models, exact `prisma/schema.prisma`
>   field names) and the live dev data profile were documented — the data profile itself could
>   not be executed in this environment (dev-DB access denied from this sandbox's egress IP; see
>   the readiness check's §4 for the attempted methodology and the access-denial detail) and is
>   recorded as a blocking gap, not silently skipped.
> - API response impact (11 routes) and UI impact (8 areas) reviewed and documented; `GET
>   /api/finance/conveyance` and the Collections routes/UI were flagged as the highest-risk
>   surfaces for this future conversion (raw unformatted numbers today, no Decimal-safe boundary).
> - First-conversion-batch recommendation recorded: the conservative option (`Expense`/
>   `EmployeeAdvance`/`TravelClaim` only), deferring `Payment`/`Collection` to a second batch
>   because their conversion is inherently bundled with retiring the `round2()`/epsilon-comparison
>   workaround in `src/lib/payments.ts`.
> - **No schema/runtime behavior changed.** `prisma/schema.prisma` untouched, no migration
>   generated or applied, no API route or UI component modified, and no database row was read,
>   written, or altered (the only DB interaction attempted was rejected at the connection-auth
>   stage before any query executed). `npx prisma validate`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, and `npm run
>   build` all pass (no code changed, so these are reconfirmations, not new test surface).
